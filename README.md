NetworkDLS New Technology Database System. (Nostalgic archive, do not use).

🗃️ Keep in kind that this is a legacy utility, originally designed for Windows 95/98 and 2000 and is archived here for acedemic and historical purposes.

This was written by myself when I was a teenager, it is not to be used for any serious purposes. It literally serves no purpose other than nostalgia for myself.

This was the hunble beginning of a project that would change names, languages, span decades, architectures and even the bedroom provided by my mom. 😄
